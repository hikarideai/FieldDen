# FieldDen
FieldDen is a simple 2D plotter.
It features:
 * Expression parsing
 * Zooming
 * Color trancparency
 * HSL Color interpolation
 * Screenshots
 
This project lacks a lot of features, like 60 fps 24/7, HSL Color wheel, cool sliders, function support, mouse control, friendly UI, config.json and well written code. Of course until version 1.0 is released. I'm looking forward to finish the development and offer a great solution.

Uses SFML and rapidjson.
