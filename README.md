# FieldDen
FieldDen is a simple 2D plotter.
It features:
 * Equation parser
 * Zooming
 * Color trancparency
 * HSL Color interpolation
 
This project lack a lot of features, like 60 fps 24/7, HSL Color wheel, cool sliders, function support, mouse control, friendly UI and well written code. Of course until version 1.0 is released. I'm looking forward to finish the devlopment and offer great solution.

Please, share knowledge.
